# Data_Collection_with_API
Using an API for data collection is a powerful way to obtain real-time or historical data for data analysis, machine learning models, or any data-driven application.

---Created a Spotify Developers account to get the Client ID and Client Secret

---First write a code to authenticate with Spotify API and obtain access token using Client Credentials Flow. 
Note: Without the access token, our application will not be able to interact with Spotify's data and services under Client Credentials flow. This flow is used for server-to-server interactions where no user authorization is required.

---Then write a Python function to extract detailed information about each track in any Spotify Playlist

---Using our Python function (get_trending_playlist_data) we extract detailed information using Spotify playlist ID and already obtained access token

---If required save the data obtained to a CSV file
